# Changelog

All notable changes to OllamaPilot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-14

### Added
- **Diagnostics-aware agent** — new `get_diagnostics` tool checks VS Code errors/warnings after edits and self-corrects
- **Apply code from chat** — "Apply" button on every code block with diff preview before applying
- **Slash commands** — 7 built-in commands (`/test`, `/fix`, `/review`, `/doc`, `/explain`, `/refactor`, `/optimize`) with autocomplete dropdown
- **Chat input history** — ↑/↓ arrow keys in empty input to cycle through previous messages (last 50)
- **Terminal output reading** — new `read_terminal` tool reads recent output from VS Code integrated terminals (1.93+ shell integration with fallback)
- **Pinned files** — always-in-context files that persist across messages and VS Code restarts, with 📌+ button in context bar
- **Compact with summary** — dropped messages are summarized by the model before removal during context compaction
- **FIM inline completions** — switched from chat API to `/api/generate` with prefix/suffix for proper fill-in-the-middle completions

### Changed
- Agent tool count increased from 18 to 21 (added `get_diagnostics`, `read_terminal`, `refactor_multi_file`)
- Test suite updated to validate 21 tools
- README updated with all new features, tools table, keyboard shortcuts, and v0.5.0 roadmap section

### Fixed
- **Type safety** — `pinnedFiles` added to `MsgSendMessage` interface (was `any` cast)
- **Pinned files dedup** — now deduplicates against smart context files, not just @mentions
- **Pin button UX** — 📌+ now inserts `@` at cursor position instead of overwriting input text
- **Pin mode race condition** — `pinModeActive` flag properly reset when user breaks out of @mention flow
- **Stale workspace closure** — pinned files and git diff now use `this._currentWorkspaceRoot` instead of stale closure from `resolveWebviewView`
- **Dead import** — removed unused `import * as os` from agent.ts
- **.gitignore encoding** — rewrote in clean UTF-8 (was corrupted with UTF-16LE entries)
- **.vscodeignore encoding** — same fix

## [0.3.1] - 2025-06-13

### Added
- **Python tooling integration** — auto-detects Python environment (linter, formatter, test framework, type checker, package manager) and injects project-specific guidance into the system prompt
- **Code Lens provider** — "✨ Explain" and "📝 Document" lenses above functions/classes for 12 languages (opt-in via `ollamaAgent.codeLens.enabled`)
- **Undo last tool** — "↩ Undo" button on file operation toasts to revert create/edit/write/append/delete
- **Language-aware documentation** — docs code action uses correct doc style per language (JSDoc, docstrings, Javadoc, KDoc, Doxygen, YARD, PHPDoc, etc.)
- **Language-aware test generation** — tests code action uses correct framework per language (pytest, Jest, JUnit, xUnit, RSpec, PHPUnit, etc.)
- **Advanced prompt templates** — conditional blocks `{?var}...{/var}`, export/import templates as JSON
- **E2E tests** — 13 integration tests for workspace module (Python detection, file tree, etc.)
- **Code coverage** — `npm run test:coverage` via nyc/istanbul
- **esbuild bundling** — extension now ships as a single bundled file

### Changed
- **Package size reduced from 2,627 files (10.9 MB) to 14 files (6.9 MB)** via esbuild bundling
- Test suite expanded to 160 tests across 12 modules
- `run_command` tool description now mentions pytest, ruff, mypy, eslint, tsc
- Text-mode tool instructions include Python-specific examples

### Fixed
- Unreachable `break` statement in code action switch (dead code removed)

### Added
- **Enhanced diff view** with accept/reject options and keyboard shortcuts (Alt+A/Alt+R)
- **Inline code completions** — automatic suggestions as you type, manual trigger with Alt+C
- **Multi-file refactoring** — coordinated changes across multiple files with preview UI
- **Export chat** — save conversations as Markdown or JSON
- **@symbol mentions** — attach workspace symbols (functions, classes) to messages
- **Multi-workspace folder support** — isolated agents per workspace folder
- **Comprehensive test suite** — 147 unit tests across 11 modules (Mocha + Sinon)
- **Marketplace banner** — 1280×640 dark-themed banner image
- `npm test` and `npm run test:unit` scripts

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2025-03-13

### Added
- **Explain selection shortcut** — `Ctrl+Shift+E` / `Cmd+Shift+E` to instantly explain selected code
- **Model presets** — fast/balanced/quality presets with bidirectional sync
- **Code actions provider** — 6 right-click actions (Explain, Comment, Refactor, Bugs, Tests, Docs)

- **Prompt templates** — 6 built-in templates + custom template management with variable substitution
- **Smart context selection** — auto-include imported/related files with relevance scoring
- **Search in chat** — find, highlight, and navigate matches within conversations

### Fixed
- Memory leak in search highlight DOM manipulation
- Memory leak in Agent history (explicit disposal in 4 locations)
- Race condition in preset/model circular updates (dual-flag pattern)
- Race condition in workspace change detection (mutex)
- Race condition in file index rebuild (immediate indexing)
- Race condition in smart context file limit (uses config)

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP support

**Breaking Changes:**
- None - fully backward compatible

**Recommended Actions:**

2. Pull embedding model: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. Review new memory settings in VS Code preferences
4. Consider enabling `ollamaAgent.memory.autoSave` for automatic context capture
