# Changelog

All notable changes to OllamaPilot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Multi-tab chat support** — sidebar panel supports multiple independent chat tabs; tabs persist across VS Code restarts with their own session history
- **Dream agent / self-healing loop** (`src/dreamAgent.ts`) — background Agent instance reads `feedback.md` and per-task session logs, distills candidate behavioral rules, and writes them to `.ollamapilot/proposed_rules.md`; a VS Code notification prompts the user to review
- **Thumbs-down feedback button** — 👎 button on every assistant message logs negative feedback to `.ollamapilot/feedback.md` for the dream agent to consume
- **`OllamaPilot: Accept Proposed Rules` command** — merges `## Rule:` blocks from `proposed_rules.md` into `context.md` under `## Learned Rules`, then clears the proposals file
- **`extractModelSelfTalk` in webview.js** — detects Gemma4 / Qwen3 internal monologue (splits on "Final Answer:", then strips leading self-talk paragraphs) and routes it into the collapsible thinking panel
- **Gemma4 / Qwen3 think-block support** — `<think>` blocks collapsed by default; self-talk hidden from the main chat view
- **SSH non-interactive mode** — `run_command` SSH calls use `BatchMode=yes`, `ConnectTimeout=10`, and `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` to prevent agent hangs on interactive prompts
- **Windows bash/Git Bash routing** — on Windows, `run_command` and `shell_read` now probe for Git Bash (`C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe` and common paths) before falling back to PowerShell; when found, all commands (including `ssh`/`scp`/`sftp`) are routed through `bash.exe -c "…"`, giving the agent full Unix tooling (`grep`, `find`, `sed`, `head`, etc.); if bash is not installed, the system prompt includes a `winget install Git.Git` hint
- **Gemma4:26b-65k model support** — added to `MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMITS` in `contextCalculator.ts`
- **Per-task plan files** — `plans/<task-slug>.md` auto-created at agent run start for each task
- **`OllamaPilot: Ingest Markdown` command** — wired up `ingestMarkdownFiles` to a registered command so users can import workspace `.md` files into memory from the command palette
- **`ollamaAgent.acceptDiff` / `ollamaAgent.rejectDiff` commands** — registered handlers for the `Alt+A` / `Alt+R` keybindings (close the active diff editor; the confirmation dialog drives the actual accept/reject)
- **Context bar** — running context percentage in the chat footer, with amber/red thresholds at 75% / 95%

### Fixed
- Removed dead `_proposedRulesReminded` field from `src/agent.ts` (was never read or set after refactor)
- Path traversal bypass in file tool validation
- Logger over-redaction stripping legitimate content
- Tab race conditions and UI state bugs in multi-tab chat
- **PowerShell cmdlet list inconsistency** — `Out-Host` was missing from the `runCommandStreaming` routing; unified both functions to use a shared `PS_CMDLETS` constant
- **Multi-plan stop race** — `setImmediate` callback now re-checks `stopRef.stop` before launching the next plan step; prevents orphaned agent runs when `stop()` is called between steps
- **SSH regex in `runShellRead`** — regex `/^s[sc]p?h?$/` was malformed and could match unrelated binaries; corrected to `/^(ssh|scp|sftp)$/`
- **Silent memory write failures** — all fire-and-forget `.catch(() => {})` calls on memory operations now log a warning via `logWarn` instead of silently dropping errors

## [Unreleased] — prior

### Added
- **SQLAlchemy model integrity check** — after any `models/*.py` edit, scans for multiple FK columns referencing the same table without `foreign_keys=` on relationships; blocks with a specific `AmbiguousForeignKeysError` warning before the model continues
- **Substantive analysis bypass** (`isSubstantiveAnalysis`) — responses >2000 chars with 2+ `##` headings and a closing question only in the final 300 chars are treated as complete analysis reports, not stalls; suppresses the `isSummaryWithQuestion` auto-retry that was looping on planning/discussion sessions
- **`isConfirmStop` expanded patterns** — now catches "Should I proceed?", "Should we proceed?", "Ready to implement?", "Want to proceed?" in addition to the existing "Shall I proceed?" variants; prevents `isAskingPermission` from firing on complete analysis reports with natural handoff questions
- **Structured auto-compact summarization** — 99% context auto-compaction now runs full LLM-based structured JSON extraction (same prompt as manual compact) instead of regex scraping; saves task, confirmed files, ruled-out files, decisions, edits made, and next steps to Tier 2 memory
- **`preProcessEditTask` returns `pendingSteps`** — completion checklist items from the pre-processor are now passed back to the agent and stored in `_activeTask.stepsPending`, giving the task state machine real content to track
- **Step completion cross-reference** — after a successful `edit_file`, matching steps in `stepsPending` are automatically moved to `stepsCompleted` based on the edited file's basename; compaction context note includes remaining steps
- **Memory access tracking** — `recordAccess(entryId, accessType)` now appends timestamped events to `accessHistory[]` (capped at 50); called at system prompt load (`passive_load`), `memory_search` return (`search_result`), and post-response snippet match (`search_hit`)
- **`_recentSearchResultIds`** — agent tracks entry IDs returned by `memory_search` each turn; checks if model response text contains a snippet from any of them and upgrades to `search_hit` access type
- **Tag-based TTL rules** in `demoteStaleEntries` — `auto-compact`/`session` tags expire after 7 days (delete), discovery/file-resolution tags after 30 days (demote), session-end/completed tags after 60 days (demote), untagged entries use the existing threshold
- **Tier 5 pruning** — entries older than 180 days with zero `search_hit` accesses are permanently deleted (including Qdrant cleanup)
- **`findById` on `TieredMemoryManager`** — searches all tiers by entry ID, used by the `search_hit` upgrade path
- **`edit_file` append fallback** — when `old_string` is not found AND `new_string` starts with a function/method definition AND `old_string` is ≤10 lines, immediately injects the last 30 lines of the file with line numbers on the first failure rather than requiring two failures
- **Qwen3.5 27B tested and confirmed** — validated on `qwen3.5:27b-49k` with 262k context; performs reliably on multi-file agentic tasks including planning, exploration, and code editing with thinking mode enabled

### Fixed
- `isSummaryWithQuestion` false-positive on complete analysis reports ending with "Should I proceed?" — was looping 4+ times on planning/discussion sessions
- Auto-compact at 99% was silently discarding all discovered facts; now preserves them in Tier 2 memory via structured extraction

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-14

### Added
- **Diagnostics-aware agent** — new `get_diagnostics` tool checks VS Code errors/warnings after edits and self-corrects
- **Apply code from chat** — "Apply" button on every code block with diff preview before applying
- **Slash commands** — 7 built-in commands (`/test`, `/fix`, `/review`, `/doc`, `/explain`, `/refactor`, `/optimize`) with autocomplete dropdown
- **Chat input history** — ↑/↓ arrow keys in empty input to cycle through previous messages (last 50)
- **Terminal output reading** — new `read_terminal` tool reads recent output from VS Code integrated terminals (1.93+ shell integration with fallback)
- **Pinned files** — always-in-context files that persist across messages and VS Code restarts, with 📌+ button in context bar
- **Compact with summary** — dropped messages are summarized by the model before removal during context compaction
- **FIM inline completions** — switched from chat API to `/api/generate` with prefix/suffix for proper fill-in-the-middle completions

### Changed
- Agent tool count increased from 18 to 21 (added `get_diagnostics`, `read_terminal`, `refactor_multi_file`)
- Test suite updated to validate 21 tools
- README updated with all new features, tools table, keyboard shortcuts, and v0.5.0 roadmap section

### Fixed
- **Type safety** — `pinnedFiles` added to `MsgSendMessage` interface (was `any` cast)
- **Pinned files dedup** — now deduplicates against smart context files, not just @mentions
- **Pin button UX** — 📌+ now inserts `@` at cursor position instead of overwriting input text
- **Pin mode race condition** — `pinModeActive` flag properly reset when user breaks out of @mention flow
- **Stale workspace closure** — pinned files and git diff now use `this._currentWorkspaceRoot` instead of stale closure from `resolveWebviewView`
- **Dead import** — removed unused `import * as os` from agent.ts
- **.gitignore encoding** — rewrote in clean UTF-8 (was corrupted with UTF-16LE entries)
- **.vscodeignore encoding** — same fix

## [0.3.1] - 2025-06-13

- **Language-aware documentation** — docs code action uses correct doc style per language (JSDoc, docstrings, Javadoc, KDoc, Doxygen, YARD, PHPDoc, etc.)
- **Language-aware test generation** — tests code action uses correct framework per language (pytest, Jest, JUnit, xUnit, RSpec, PHPUnit, etc.)
- **Advanced prompt templates** — conditional blocks `{?var}...{/var}`, export/import templates as JSON
